Installing Repo


Repo is a tool that makes it easier to work with Git in the context of Android. For more information about Repo, see Version Control.


To install, initialize, and configure Repo, follow these steps:


Make sure you have a bin/ directory in your home directory, and that it is included in your path by using the following commands.


    mkdir ~/bin 
    PATH=~/bin:$PATH
    
    
Download the Repo script and ensure it is executable:


     curl https://dl-ssl.google.com/dl/googlesource/git-repo/repo > ~/bin/repo
     chmod a+x ~/bin/repo
     
     
After installing repo: 

Open the android disk that you have just created in your home directory by typing the following:


    mkdir system
    cd system
    
    
Initialize the repository of your choice:

to initialize the stock rom repository


    repo init -u git://github.com/CNA/android_manifest.git -b stock
    
    
or to initialize the modified rom repository


    repo init -u git://github.com/CNA/android_manifest.git -b mod
    

Getting the files
To pull down files to your working directory from the repositories as specified in the default manifest, run


    repo sync


The Android source files will be located in your working directory under their project names. The initial sync operation will take an hour or more to complete.
